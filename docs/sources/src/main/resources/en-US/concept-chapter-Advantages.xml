  <title>Advantages of the CDI Telco Framework</title>
  <para>Loose coupling and reusability of SIP Components across different applications are the most obvious advantages over the current SIP Servlets 1.1 specification. In addition to that, you get better integration with Java EE 6.</para>
<para>
In the future we will try to explore further usage of this component-based approach to allow application developers to compose their applications in a new way and benefits from Modularization within a single application which should give additional performance improvements over SIP Servlets Application Routing and Chaining while you can still use the latter.
